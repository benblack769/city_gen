Notes about city_gen

Tiling:

If we ever want to create a truely large interacting world, the only way to do this reasonably is through tiling.

Basically there are points, at the very smallest tile size. 

If there is an interaction within a certain distance of that tile, then it goes and computes things in terms of those smallest points.

If there is an interaction outside of that distance, then it starts working with the next largest tile size, then the next largest, etc.

So ones path to work may look like:

Key:
- (smallest tile)
x (second smallest tile)
^ (Third smallest tile)

---
  -xx
   xx
   xxxx^^^^
   xxxx^^^^
       ^^^^xx-
       ^^^^xx
       
This way, any pathing or spacial analysis can happen in log^2 time with the world size instead of quadratic.

There will be accumulated stats for each tile size, so this optimization will take up n*log(world_size)^2, instead of n, but I think we can deal.
