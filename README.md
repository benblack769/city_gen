# city_gen

## Purpose

This currently has a dual purpose, for the short and long term.

For now this is a tool to explore large scale interactions between people in the modern world, by simulating small scale interactions.
It is not meant to accuratly model the world, rather it is meant to explore possible ways that the world interacts.

Eventually, it should turn into a framework for a potencial game exploring those large scale interactions. 
One possible such game is a democratic political simulator, where you 
try to build a policy framework that satisfies your consituents. It is there to entertain people by having them consider and deal with 
the subtle parts of what makes people happy on a region wide scale.
