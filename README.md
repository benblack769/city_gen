# City Generator

## Installation

Requires Qt 5.

Can be built using standard QT methods.

## Overview

### Inspiration

I was inspired by city simulation games, in particular SimCity 4, and their power to model the real world in a level of detail that allows you to create realistic feeling cities. 

## Other dreams

Notes for these ideas and some much larger ideas are in `notes.md`. These are not really meant to be read by people other than myself, but maybe they will be helpful.
